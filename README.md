> Basic generator for express using npm as a build tool and babel eslint mocha chai

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-express-plus-plus using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-express-plus-plus
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo express-plus-plus
```

You can then run
```bash
npm run lint // Runs eslint
npm run test // Runs mocha after linting with eslint
npm run build // To create dist file with all assets
npm start:dev // Runs non compiled files
npm start // Runs files in dist/ folder
```

### Warning: currently the dist/ folder is versioned. If that's not your workflow, add it to .gitignore
